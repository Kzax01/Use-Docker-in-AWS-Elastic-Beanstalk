## 📦 Docker Image Creation and Deployment on AWS Elastic Beanstalk

Welcome to our exploration of Containers on AWS! 
 
Now, let’s dive into our practical project: creating a Docker image and deploying it on Elastic Beanstalk.

### 🛠️ Project Overview : 
In this project, we will create a Docker image and deploy it on AWS Elastic Beanstalk.

### 🛠️ Building a Custom Docker Image
We’ll create a custom Docker image using a Dockerfile, which contains instructions for building the image. We’ll use the latest Nginx image as a base and replace the default page with our own `index.html`.

### ✅ Testing the Image Locally
After building our Docker image, we’ll test it locally with the command `docker run -p 80:80` to ensure our custom page displays correctly before cloud deployment.

### ☁️ Deploying on AWS Elastic Beanstalk
Once verified, we'll deploy the Docker image on AWS Elastic Beanstalk, which simplifies infrastructure management and scaling. It automatically provisions resources and handles deployment for us.

This project is a great resource for anyone wanting to learn about containerizing applications with Docker and deploying them on AWS Elastic Beanstalk!
