### 🛠️ **Project Overview**  
Here’s what you’ll learn in this project:  
- **Building a Custom Docker Image**: Create a Docker image using a `Dockerfile` that customizes the latest **Nginx** image with a personalized `index.html`.  
- **Testing Locally**: Test the image locally with `docker run -p 80:80` to ensure everything works perfectly before deploying.  
- **Deploying to AWS Elastic Beanstalk**: Deploy your Docker image to Elastic Beanstalk and let AWS handle scaling and infrastructure management.
